Internet marketing has taken over traditional marketing strategies in the recent past. Companies prefer to advertise their products on websites and social media platforms. However, targeting the right audience is still a challenge in online marketing. Spending millions to display the advertisement to the audience that is not likely to buy your products can be costly.
Imagine a user visiting a website and there would be different product adds on the website. From the set of displayed adds, the user clicks on certain ones that he/she is interested in. And the goal is to predict this metric using the dataset described in the following section.
Identify users who would be interested in different product adds on Amex card website.

The Blueprint : 
1.	Data Collection
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis — First, “get to know” the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.
3.	Data Cleaning — Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.
4.	Feature Engineering — Next, help your algorithms “focus” on what’s important by creating new features.
5.	Model Training and tuning — Finally, train your models. This step is formulaic. Here I have used Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
6.	Insights — Final results which will eventually boost up the business
The Logistic Regression model provides an accuracy of 93% and ANN model provides an accuracy of about 92.31%.

Note:  The accuracy of ANN model could be increased by adding in more hidden layers, more epochs, and by using different type of optimizer. Which was not tried at this point in time.
